N-Queens Problem Analysis (4 to 10 queens)

1. Performance Analysis of Backtracking Strategy:
------------------------------------------------
- For N=4 to 7: Shows acceptable performance (0-15ms)
- For N=8: Performance starts degrading significantly (259ms)
- For N=9: Somewhat inconsistent performance (75ms)
- For N=10: Shows clear exponential growth (1540ms)

Key observations:
* The time complexity grows exponentially with board size
* Performance becomes impractical for larger boards (N > 10)
* Guaranteed to find a solution if one exists
* Systematic but inefficient approach for larger N

2. Comparison with Min-Conflicts Strategy:
----------------------------------------
Performance comparison:
N=4:  Backtracking(2ms)  vs Min-Conflicts(1ms)
N=5:  Backtracking(0ms)  vs Min-Conflicts(0ms)
N=6:  Backtracking(15ms) vs Min-Conflicts(35ms)
N=7:  Backtracking(0ms)  vs Min-Conflicts(0ms)
N=8:  Backtracking(259ms) vs Min-Conflicts(3ms)
N=9:  Backtracking(75ms) vs Min-Conflicts(1ms)
N=10: Backtracking(1540ms) vs Min-Conflicts(4ms)

Key advantages of Min-Conflicts:
* Maintains consistent performance even for larger N
* Scales much better (almost constant time)
* More efficient for practical applications
* Particularly well-suited for N-Queens problem

3. Conclusions:
--------------
1. Algorithm Choice:
   - For small boards (N â‰¤ 7): Both strategies are viable
   - For larger boards (N > 7): Min-conflicts is clearly superior
   - For production use: Min-conflicts is recommended

2. Scalability:
   - Backtracking shows clear exponential growth
   - Min-conflicts maintains near-constant time performance
   - The difference becomes more pronounced as N increases

3. Trade-offs:
   - Backtracking: Guaranteed to find solution but slow
   - Min-conflicts: Fast but not guaranteed (though very reliable for N-Queens)

4. Practical Implications:
   - For real applications, min-conflicts is the better choice
   - The natural modeling approach works well with both strategies
   - The problem demonstrates why local search can outperform systematic search for certain types of problems
