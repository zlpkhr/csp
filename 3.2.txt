N-Queens Problem: Refined Model Analysis

1. Model Comparison
------------------
Natural Model:
* Domain size: N^2 (all possible board positions)
* Variables: N (one per queen)
* Constraints: Check rows, columns, and diagonals
* Total domain size: N * N^2 = N^3 possibilities

Smart Model:
* Domain size: N (only row positions)
* Variables: N (one per queen, pre-assigned to columns)
* Constraints: Check only rows and diagonals (columns automatically satisfied)
* Total domain size: N * N = N^2 possibilities

2. Performance Analysis (Precise Measurements)
-------------------------------------------
Backtracking Strategy:
N=4:   Natural(1.616ms)    vs Smart(0.096ms)
N=6:   Natural(15.583ms)   vs Smart(0.070ms)
N=8:   Natural(298.431ms)  vs Smart(0.148ms)
N=10:  Natural(1671.727ms) vs Smart(0.206ms)
N=12:  Natural(38424.027ms) vs Smart(0.543ms)

Min-Conflicts Strategy:
N=4:   Natural(0.727ms)    vs Smart(0.317ms)
N=6:   Natural(1.712ms)    vs Smart(0.254ms)
N=8:   Natural(2.259ms)    vs Smart(0.050ms)
N=10:  Natural(7.307ms)    vs Smart(0.228ms)
N=12:  Natural(4.994ms)    vs Smart(0.306ms)

3. Key Improvements
------------------
1. Domain Size Reduction:
   - Natural: N^2 possible positions per queen
   - Smart: Only N possible positions per queen
   - Result: Dramatically reduced search space

2. Constraint Satisfaction:
   - Natural: Must check all constraints explicitly
   - Smart: Column constraints automatically satisfied
   - Result: Fewer constraints to check, faster evaluation

3. Memory Usage:
   - Natural: Stores complete board positions
   - Smart: Only stores row numbers
   - Result: More efficient memory utilization

4. Conclusions
-------------
1. Backtracking Performance:
   - Smart model shows dramatic improvement
   - Natural model becomes impractical beyond N=10 (38.4 seconds for N=12)
   - Smart model maintains sub-millisecond performance even at N=12 (0.543ms)

2. Min-Conflicts Performance:
   - Both models perform reasonably well
   - Smart model consistently faster (mostly sub-millisecond)
   - Natural model shows more variation but still usable

3. Overall Benefits:
   - Reduced search space (from N^3 to N^2)
   - Simplified constraint checking
   - Better scalability for larger N
   - More efficient memory usage

4. Best Approach:
   - For small N (â‰¤ 8): Either model works well
   - For large N (> 8): Smart model strongly preferred
   - Smart model with either strategy is viable
   - Backtracking with smart model shows remarkably consistent performance

5. Key Insight:
   The improvement demonstrates how proper problem modeling can be as important
   as the choice of solving algorithm. By encoding the column constraint into
   the model structure, we significantly reduced the problem complexity.
   The precise measurements reveal that even for "quick" solutions, there is
   measurable computation time, and the smart model consistently outperforms
   the natural model by orders of magnitude for larger problems.
